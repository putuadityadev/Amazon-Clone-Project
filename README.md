# Amazon-Clone-Project
This project is an interactive clone of the Amazon website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design, dynamic content, and interactive elements like product listings and a shopping cart. The goal is to enhance my JavaScript skills while creating a functional web application.
